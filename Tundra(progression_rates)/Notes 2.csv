"Data to support the release of TUNDRA LSOA, based on Lower-Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs). (September 2020)",,,,
,,,,
This dataset was published by the Office for Students in September 2020. ,,,,
"It provides data to support the release of the TUNDRA areas-based classification using LSOAs, called TUNDRA LSOA. ",,,,
"It includes mapping from the 2011 LSOA and 2011 Middle-layer super output area (MSOA) codes, to the young participation area-based measures TUNDRA LSOA and TUNDRA MSOA.",,,,
"The data for TUNDRA LSOA includes the young participation rate for each area for successive years, and the quintile for each area for successive years.",,,,
There have been small updates to methodology (concerning de-duplication of data) since the original experimental TUNDRA classification in September 2019.  These updates have resulted in small changes to the MSOA classification: this is included in the data and the name has been changed to TUNDRA MSOA.,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
"The dataset includes 2011 LSOAs and their TUNDRA quintiles, and 2011 MSOAs and their TUNDRA quintiles.",,,,
"Lastly, it includes the difference between the LSOA quintile, and the quintile of the MSOA in which it lies for the 1014 classifications. ",,,,
,,,,
Further information about the LSOA and MSOA geographies is available at: ,,,,

,,,,
The successive classifications and young participation rates (YPR) are labelled by the summer of the years in which the cohorts included took their GCSEs.,,,,
"For example, the 2007/08 academic year cohort are called 08 as they would take GCSE exams in the summer of 2008. ",,,,
,,,,
The classifications include:,,,,
,LSOA classification name,Academic years of students taking GCSEs,YPR name,Quintile name
,TUNDRA LSOA 0711,2006/07 to 2010/11 inclusive,lsoa_YPR_0711,LSOA_Q_0711
,TUNDRA LSOA 0812,2007/08 to 2011/12 inclusive,lsoa_YPR_0812,LSOA_Q_0812
,TUNDRA LSOA 0913,2008/09 to 2012/13 inclusive,lsoa_YPR_0913,LSOA_Q_0913
,TUNDRA LSOA 1014,2009/10 to 2013/14 inclusive,lsoa_YPR_1014,LSOA_Q_1014
,,,,
"The MSOA classification is only released for the equivalent 1014 cohort, with ypr called MSOA_ypr_1014 and quintiles called MSOA_Q_1014.",,,,
,,,,
"Population information is given for the 1014 cohorts, for both LSOA and MSOA. This is called LSOA_population_1014 and MSOA_population_1014 respectively.",,,,
,,,,
The most recent classification is TUNDRA LSOA 1014 and TUNDRA MSOA 1014. The Office for Students recommend use of these latest classifications. ,,,,
"Other classifications are given for completeness, to support the analysis of the LSOA methodology.",,,,
,,,,
"Rounding:  Populations are rounded to the nearest five, and participation rates are given as a percentage rounded to one decimal place.",,,,
Suppression: Any LSOA with a population (in the LSOA 1014 classification) below 30 is suppressed. Any MSOA with a population (in the MSOA 1014 classification) below 50 is suppressed.,,,,
"Suppression due to a low population includes suppression of the population, ypr and quintile for all years reported in that dataset. ",,,,
"Areas where the data is suppressed have been included in the dataset with the area code, but the appropriate fields are blank. ",,,,
,,,,
"Note that rounding to the nearest five, combined with suppression of an LSOA population below 30, means the population was originally 30, 31 or 32.  ",,,,
"Similarly for the MSOA, rounding to the nearest five combined with suppression of an MSOA population below 50, means the population was originally 50, 51 or 52.",,,,
"If a large proportion of the TUNDRA population in an MSOA lives in just one of its constituent LSOAs, it is possible for the MSOA to be suppressed with a population below 50",,,,
"but for the LSOA to have a population of at least 30 and therefore not be suppressed.  This is very unusual, but appears with MSOA E02006934 and LSOA E01033751 for example. ",,,,
,,,,
"Extreme values of the ypr are also suppressed, so that a ypr is not reported if below 10 percent or over 90 percent. ",,,,
,,,,
Identifying the reason for suppression of data: ,,,,
,"if there is no population reported for the area, it has been suppressed due to a low population ",,,
,"if there is a population reported and the area is in quintile 1, then ypr is suppressed because it is less than 10 percent",,,
,"if there is a population reported and the area is in quintile 5, then ypr is suppressed because it is over 90 percent",,,
