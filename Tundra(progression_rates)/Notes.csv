Data to support the release of TUNDRA MSOA and LSOA (March 2021),,
,,
This dataset was published by the Office for Students in 11 March 2021. ,,
"It includes mapping from the 2011 Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) and 2011 Middle Super Output Area (MSOA) codes, to the young participation area-based measures TUNDRA LSOA and TUNDRA MSOA.",,
"The dataset includes TUNDRA quintiles, participation rates, and population count for each LSOA and MSOA.",,
,,
Further information about the LSOA and MSOA geographies is available at: ,,

"Rounding:  Populations are rounded to the nearest five, and participation rates are given as a percentage rounded to one decimal place.",,
Suppression:  Any LSOA with a population (in the LSOA 1014 classification) below 30 is suppressed. Any MSOA with a population (in the MSOA 1014 classification) below 50 is suppressed.,,
"Suppression due to a low population includes suppression of the population, participation rate and quintile. ",,
"Areas where the data is suppressed have been included in the dataset with the area code, but the appropriate fields are blank. ",,
,,
"Note that rounding to the nearest five, combined with suppression of an LSOA population below 30, means the population was originally 30, 31 or 32.  ",,
"Similarly for the MSOA, rounding to the nearest five combined with suppression of an MSOA population below 50, means the population was originally 50, 51 or 52.",,
"If a large proportion of the TUNDRA population in an MSOA lives in just one of its constituent LSOAs, it is possible for the MSOA to be suppressed with a population below 50 but for the LSOA to have a population of at least 30 and therefore not be suppressed.",,
